Course materials
----------------
We have made a wide range of materials to support your learning:

- These online lecture and lab notes are the primary learning material for the course. You should read through them, and work through the lab exercises. 

- The notes include short quiz material to help you test your knowledge.

- Brief video explainers are placed at key points in the lecture notes. These videos are not intended to cover every aspects of the course - this is fundamentally a text based course and the lecture notes the main source of content. Rather, these videos are to help explain subtle concepts, or used when a practical illustration is more informative than text. 

- In addition, there are 12 week-by-week videos, one for each week of the course. These highlight the key concepts and aims for that week of the unit, to help you move through the material. 

- For students at the University of Manchester, there is a discussion forum on Canvas. 

- For students at the University of Manchester, there are also lecture slots each week. The video recording of these will be on Canvas.
