Feedback

Our feedback to you
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The primary opportunity for getting feedback on your work is in the lab sessions. Be proactive in requesting this. We will have lots of demonstrators on-hand to answer your questions and to give you feedback or suggestions on your work. This will be formative feedback, to help guide your future work. 

The other sources for feedback to you are:

- Formative: Each lab requires you to upload some code to check your understanding. The online system will analyze your work, and give some feedback if the code doesn't work as expected. (These are the same as the formative assessments noted previously.)

- Formative: Each week in the course notes has a short quiz at the end of it. Use these to test your knowledge, moving on to the next week only once you've completed the quiz to your satisfaction.

- Formative: We have two in-person lecture sessions each week. In these we will go over key topics, as well as go over answers to the short quizzes, highlighting common issues. We will also perform code reviews for code submitted in the labs, giving suggestions for improving the code quality. 

- Summative: There is an unseen exam at the end of the course. The marks and class feedback will help you to evaluate your work and where you sit within the cohort.


Your feedback to us
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For feedback to us, please make use of the lecture and lab sessions to talk to us.

You can also click the edit on GitHub button (:fab:`github`) in the lecture notes, at the top of each page, to make suggestions for edits or additions to the material.

Feedback timelines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
All formative feedback is in real-time. The marking system will give feedback comments within a few minutes of work being submitted.

Summative feedback is released after the end of the course, together with the results for all other units at the University of Manchester.
