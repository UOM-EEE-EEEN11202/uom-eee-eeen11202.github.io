Use of AI in these notes
------------------------
These notes and programming assignments have been prepared in-line with the `University of Manchester guidance for AI in teaching <https://uom-eee-eeen11202.github.io/notes-part1/chapters/programming_fundamentals/floating_point_numbers.html>`_.

- The course has been written in VSCode (both notes and code). This has AI assistance enabled via Microsoft GitHub Copilot providing auto-complete style suggestions as the author types. Some of these suggestions have been accepted when the text was appropriate to accelerate typing in essentially the exact same text.
- No prompt based tools have been used to generate text or code in these notes, apart from in `Lab I <https://uom-eee-eeen11202.github.io/notes-part2/chapters/week6/lab_i.html>`_ where the lab looks at AI tools. 
- Background research used conventional search engines (e.g. Google). Prompt based AI tools were not used, but modern search engines may augment their results with AI generated text.
