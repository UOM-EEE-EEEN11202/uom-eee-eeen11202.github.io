Assessments
-----------
There are two parts to the assessment of your learning in the course:

Formative
^^^^^^^^^
There are 20 lab based assignments, one for each lab session, that need to be submitted to an online system for marking. These contribute 50% to the overall unit mark. 

There is just one deadline for all of these, at the end of the course. See the :ref:`unit delivery plan <unit_delivery_plan>` for the exact date. However, they are intended to be tackled week-by-week to help you track your progress through the course and to let us give :ref:`feedback <feedback>` on your work.

You should do each lab before attempting the assignment associated with the lab, but for ease direct links to the assignments are given below. You'll need to be signed in to GitHub with the account you use for the labs for these links to work. 

- `Assignments A to J <https://friendly-invention-pr7lnwj.pages.github.io/index.html>`_. These assignments relate to the labs in `Part 2 of the course <https://uom-eee-eeen11202.github.io/notes-part2/>`_.

- `Assignments K to T <https://fluffy-adventure-qm5zj92.pages.github.io/>`_. These assignments relate to the labs in `Part 3 of the course <https://uom-eee-eeen11202.github.io/notes-part3/>`_.


Summative
^^^^^^^^^
There is an unseen closed book exam at the end of the course. This contributes 50% of the overall unit mark.

This is a computer based exam. It will consist of a mixture of knowledge based questions (such as multiple choice, fill in the blank), and coding tasks. In coding tasks you will be asked to complete short programs (like you might be asked in a job interview) and will have to upload your code for marking.
