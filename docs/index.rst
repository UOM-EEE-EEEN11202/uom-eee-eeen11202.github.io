Course introduction
===================

Wellcome to EEEN1XXX2 *Introduction to programming and software development*. The course aims to introduce students to programming, using languages such as Python and Rust, to let them automate common computer tasks.

These course notes are split into 3 parts.

- `Part 0 (this part) on course adminstration. <https://uom-eee-eeen1xxx2.github.io/>`_ These notes provide an overview of the course administration: the intended learning outcomes and other information needed to work through the course. The notes also provides information on how to install a suitable programming environment for using with the course.

- `Part 1 on general purpose computing, mainly with Python. <https://uom-eee-eeen1xxx2.github.io/notes-part1/>`_ These notes cover the first half of the course, where we'll look at how to automate tasks on a computer, and use programming to analyse and explore and visuliase data. We'll mainly use Python for this, as a very widely used programming language, but will also look briefly at *Shell Scripting* as as a method built in to most operating systems. This part also covers some of the underlying theory that's needed for the course. Computers work in a particular way, and we need to know some details about they ways in which they work in order to write good programs. 

- `Part 2 on higher performance computing, mainly with Rust. <https://uom-eee-eeen1xxx2.github.io/notes-part2/>`_ These notes cover the second half of the course, where we'll look at how to write programs that can run more quickly. This may be because we're writing a large program which takes a long time to run, or because we only have limited computing resources avaiable, or some other reason. In general, Python is a great tool for writing programs quickly, but they tend to execute relatively slowly. We thus use other lanugagues when high performance computing starts to become more important. Here we're going to look mainly at a lunage called Rust, but we'll also look briefly at C and C++ as widely used alternatives.
