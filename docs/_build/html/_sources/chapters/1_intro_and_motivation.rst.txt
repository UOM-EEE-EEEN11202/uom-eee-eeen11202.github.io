Course overview and motivation
==============================


Introduction
------------

This first part of the course aims to give the motivations for studying programming; to show why programming is an important skill to learn. It also gives some background and wider/general information to set the context for the rest of the course. 


Where you'll use this knowledge
-------------------------------

Here essential motivation. Some of this is background knowledge to set the scene, which you may or may not use directly. 

The information on "Background: Inside a computer" is core to this course. In particular, if you've not used the command line before it's introduced here for the first time. You'll use the command line a lot in this course, and very likely in any other programming tasks that you carry out for your degree or at work.
